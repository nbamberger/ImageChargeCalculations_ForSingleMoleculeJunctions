# ImageChargeCalculations_ForSingleMoleculeJunctions

IMPORTANT: For the primary version of this repository that is maintained by LabMonti, go to https://github.com/LabMonti/ImageChargeCalculations_ForSingleMoleculeJunctions. This clone was created in August 2021 as a record of my personal contributions. All of the code in this repository was written by me.

This software package implements a simple image charge model with numerous visualization tools for investigating transport level renormalization in single molecule junctions. This package was used to perform all of the image charge analysis described in Ivie and Bamberger et al. 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c19404). 

This package was tested using MATLAB release 2020b, but it should be backwards and forwards compatible (if you run into issues please let us know!). In addition to the main MATLAB download, the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox is needed. 

New users should start by opening MATLAB and going through the live script "ImageChargeAnalysis_Tutorial.mlx".

Make sure to also check out our sister repository, the SMAUG-Toolbox at github.com/LabMonti/SMAUG-Toolbox!  SMAUG contains numerous graphical analysis tools for investigating breaking trace data from single-molecule conductance experiments, including a novel segmentation-based clustering algorithm described in Bamberger et al. 2020 (doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c03612).
